Simple-SSD-Stereo
=================

This little script is for anyone interested in the basics of writing stereo-matching code. It's a (very) simple implementation of a sum of squared differences (SSD), support-window based stereo-matching algorithm.

It takes a left and right image (that have to be the same size) and outputs a depth (disparity) map.

Resulting depth map:

It's not particularly fast (seriously - go make a cup of tea or something when running with any images pairs larger than 400x350), but my aim was to experiment with the actual technique rather than make the fastest Python code evar. The bowling ball test images provided with this code are from the Middlebury stereo dataset 2006<sup>[1]</sup>.

It depends on Numpy (http://www.numpy.org), Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org) and PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil)
